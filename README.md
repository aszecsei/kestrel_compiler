# kestrel_compiler

This was an assignment for CS:4980 Compiler Construction. The project was to implement a compiler for the [Kestrel](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/compiler/kestrel/) programming language, targeting the Raspberry Pi's ARM architecture.

To that end, several test cases were constructed, using a C compiler to find the assembly implementation of a variety of C statements. These samples can be found in the `assemblySamples` folder. Example Kestrel programs we used for testing are in the `tests/samples` folder.

While the compiler is currently incomplete, it serves as a good base for future work in compiler development.
